    "description":"Jakarta Sewerage System project will manage domestic waste treatment in 15 zones (including zones that have been in operation), with the initial focus on Zones 1 and 6. Both are targeted for operation in 2021. Zone 1 will serve the central and north areas and Zone 6 will serve the west area. Total cost of Zone 1 project is ± IDR 8 Trillion, while the development of Zone 6 will cost ± IDR 5 Trillion.",
    "significance":"As the nation’s capital city, DKI Jakarta has developed as a center of government, business, and industry. Since the development is not accompanied by the improvement of disposal system for handling wastes generated, the condition of water and sanitation in Jakarta has increasingly worsened. Currently, the coverage ratio in DKI Jakarta is only 4% of the entire area with a BOD pollution rate of 84 mg/l. This condition makes DKI Jakarta the second lowest capital city in Southeast Asia in terms of sanitation. In addition to the above, JSS is also needed to support the effectiveness of the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD), which has commenced with construction. Since the development of waste water treatment plant is crucial to NCICD development, this project has become a priority to the central government with the issuance of Letter No: S-130/D.VI.M.EKON/09/2013 regarding the Acceleration of the Development of Integrated Waste Water Treatment System in DKI Jakarta, which stipulates the importance to achieve 75% coverage of waste water service area in 2022."

Large lagoons will be built within the walls to accommodate the water flow from 13 rivers in Jakarta (water reservoirs).",
    "significance":"More than half of Jakarta residents live in the coastal area and significant urban economic activities develop in the coastal area. There are 13 rivers which disembogue in Jakarta Bay and 40% of the coastal lowland area lies below tidal surface. Floods in coastal area are exacerbated by the land subsidence due to excessive extraction of ground water."
