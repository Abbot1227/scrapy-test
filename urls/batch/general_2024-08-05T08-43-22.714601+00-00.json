    "content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/topics/opec/\">Opec+</a> members that have failed to comply with output cuts, including Iraq, Russia and Kazakhstan, have agreed to reduce their production in the coming months to compensate for breaking agreed quotas.</p> <p>The combined overproduction from the three members totalled 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of the year, according to an assessment by secondary sources, Opec said in a statement.</p> <p>Iraq overproduced 1.2 million bpd, Russia 480,000 bpd and Kazakhstan 620,000 bpd.</p> <p>Opec uses independent sources, which include international consultancies, to assess capacity and output figures.</p> <p>Iraq and Kazakhstan will start trimming their output this month, while Russia will begin cuts in October 2024.</p> <p>According to the plan presented on Wednesday by the three countries, the overproduced volumes will be fully compensated by September 2025.</p> <p>Iraq, Opec’s second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia, has repeatedly pledged to compensate for pumping over its quota. But it has been constantly overproducing.</p> <p>The country has in the past disputed the organisation's assessment of its output and quotas, as it seeks to maximise its revenues to rebuild its economy.</p> <p>Russia’s fuel exports have also increased as refineries restarted production after they were damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks. Russia needs revenues to finance its ongoing invasion.</p> <p><strong><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Newsletter</mark></strong><br><a href=\"https://agbi.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=6dad398e61eeeae726961d9fd&amp;id=9d63dc202b\"><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Get the Best of AGBI delivered straight to your inbox every week</mark></a></p> <p>Saudi Arabian officials expressed concerns about Russia’s overproduction during a recent call with Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-exceeded-opec-oil-output-quota-june-pledges-reach-target-july-2024-07-24/\">Reuters</a>.</p> <p>Riyadh needs oil prices to remain high to finance its economic diversification and giga-projects.</p> <p>Yet Opec members' non-compliance with quotas offsets its efforts to push prices up. Despite growing geopolitical tensions, the market remains feeble amid disappointing demand from China -- the main engine of world crude demand --high interest rates and rising US crude output. </p> <p>Brent prices oscillate around $80 a barrel.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has <a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/economy/2024/07/imf-lowers-saudi-growth-forecast-over-oil-output-cuts/\">lowered</a> its forecast for economic growth in Saudi Arabia by almost an entire percentage point due to cuts in oil production.</p> <p>In June Opec extended part of its output cuts into 2025.</p>"

    "content":"<p>UK oil and gas company Energean has agreed the $1.2 billion development of the Katlan offshore gas field in Israel, with output set to start in the first half of 2027.</p> <p>The production will underpin Energean’s existing gas sales agreements with Israeli clients and target international markets.</p> <p>Katlan – owned and operated by Energean – contains 1.1 trillion cubic feet of proven and probable gas reserves. It is near the Karish and Karish North fields, which are also operated by Energean. </p> <p><strong><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Newsletter</mark></strong><br><a href=\"https://agbi.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=6dad398e61eeeae726961d9fd&amp;id=9d63dc202b\"><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Get the Best of AGBI delivered straight to your inbox every week</mark></a></p> <p>The fields are expected to produce around 7.5-8 billion cubic metres (265-282 billion cubic feet) a year, Energean’s spokesperson said.</p> <p>Export of output from Karish and Karish North is banned as the gas produced is intended to supply the domestic Israeli market. However, the Katlan project does not have any such restrictions and “there is a potential” that gas from the field will go to Egypt, the spokesperson said.</p> <p>When it began in 2020, Energean’s production freed up output from other gas fields – such as Leviathan and Tamar – for <a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/oil-and-gas/2024/06/israels-gas-export-plans-complicated-by-war/\">exports</a>. </p> <p>Leviathan, one of three Israeli offshore gas fields, is one of the largest in the Mediterranean. The nearby Tamar is a major source of Israel’s gas for power generation, and around 20 percent of its output is exported. </p> <p>Israel exports around 90 percent of its production, mainly to Egypt and Jordan. Egypt’s gas production has declined to its lowest since 2018, plunging it into a deep power crisis.</p> <p>Mathios Rigas, CEO of Energean, said: “By developing Katlan, we will unlock further value in the Israeli subsurface that will provide additional energy security and drive sustainable development, both in Israel and the broader region.”</p>"
