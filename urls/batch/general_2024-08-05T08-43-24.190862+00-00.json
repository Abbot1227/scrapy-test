    "content":"<p>Kuwait, <a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/topics/opec/\">Opec’s</a> fifth-largest oil producer but long a laggard in the energy transition, is taking steps to catch up with its neighbouring Gulf states and ease reliance on falling <a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/economy/2024/07/kuwait-turns-to-budget-deficit-as-oil-income-drops-19/\">oil revenues</a>.</p> <p>State-owned Kuwait Oil Company last week mandated KBR, the US oilfield services company, to develop a master plan to produce 17 gigawatts (GW) of renewables and 25GW of green hydrogen by 2050.</p> <p>KBR said the phased strategy involves developing “significant wind and solar power, combined with power storage capability” and the development of green hydrogen for internal industrial use and export.</p> <p><strong><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Newsletter</mark></strong><br><a href=\"https://agbi.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=6dad398e61eeeae726961d9fd&amp;id=9d63dc202b\"><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Get the Best of AGBI delivered straight to your inbox every week</mark></a></p> <p>The plan is ambitious, and Kuwait has a long history of delayed projects. Experts say government support and the ability to attract finance are crucial to making the masterplan a reality.</p> <p>Analysts say slow decision-making is one of Kuwait’s biggest challenges.</p> <p>In May, Kuwaiti Emir Meshal Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah dissolved the opposition-dominated parliament, raising hopes that major projects can move forward.</p> <p>“The biggest challenge for Kuwait to diversify is the formation of a long-lasting executive branch of government,” says Omar Al-Ubaydli, director of research at the Bahrain Center for Strategic, International and Energy Studies.</p> <p>Salem Alajmi, a Kuwait-based certified renewables expert, says the targets announced will be challenging.</p> <p>Kuwait said as long ago as 2012 that it was aiming for 15 percent of energy to come from renewable sources by 2030. However, it has only around 100 megawatts of renewables capacity. </p> <p>Green energy, produced from entirely sustainable sources, accounts for only around 1 percent of domestic electricity production, while the remainder is generated from oil and gas. </p> <p>Notably, the Al-Shagaya solar development has been delayed several times. Only the first phase has been operational, since 2017, while the second and third phases have been merged and are yet to come online, Alajmi says.</p> <p>Electricity is also heavily subsidised, which has limited the development of Kuwait’s renewables market.</p> <p>Kuwait holds about 7 percent of global oil reserves and has one of the lowest crude oil production costs of around $10 per barrel.</p> <p>But despite the windfall from oil, the country suffers from power outages amid growing electricity demand and lack of infrastructure maintenance, Alajmi said. </p> <p>It also ranks as the world’s second-largest CO2 emitter per capita, behind Qatar. However, the government has committed to achieving carbon neutrality in the oil and gas sector by 2050 and in other sectors by 2060.</p> <p>Laury Haytayan, Middle East and North Africa director at the Natural Resource Governance Institute, says energy diversification by neighbouring Gulf states is acting as a wake-up call. “The awareness of climate change and energy transitions will make Kuwait act now,” she says.</p> <p>In March, Salem Al Hajraf, the minister of electricity, water and renewable energy, unveiled a new plan to construct 22GW of renewables as part of the 2030-50 renewable energy strategy.</p> <p>“Building electricity systems that rely in large part on renewables will free a considerable amount of oil for exports, and help reduce emissions,” Haytayan says.</p> <p>Kuwait anticipates producing green hydrogen at competitive costs, estimated between $3.22 and $4.41 per kilogram, by 2032.</p> <p>But to succeed, Kuwait will need to convince investors that it has dealt with slow decision-making and demonstrate an ability to move projects forward, analysts say.</p> <p>“Introducing carbon credits, a carbon market, would facilitate the financing of the projects, \" says Alajmi.</p>"

While minimal exploration has been conducted to date, seismic studies have shown promising results. Notably, Blocks 41, 42 and 43 in the Kwanza and Namibe basins are covered in their entirety with a 2D seismic dataset, with significant syn- and post-rift potential across the entire basin identified. A panel discussion on <em>Frontier Exploration: Charting New Paths for Investment</em> during AOG 2024 will explore the strategic potential of the basin, with speakers delving into block opportunities and partnership prospects.</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">In tandem with oil production efforts, Angola is making strides towards attracting investment across the natural gas industry. The country has a target to increase the share of gas to 25% of the energy mix by 2025 and is promoting exploration opportunities, infrastructure development and monetization solutions. Major projects include the Angola LNG plant – which celebrated its 400<sup>th</sup> cargo in 2023 – and the <a href=\"https://www.eni.com/en-IT/media/press-release/2022/07/eni-announces-completion-negotiations-start-up-new-gas-consortium-angola.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quiluma and Maboqueiro</a> development, Angola’s first non-associated gas project.

They did not like what they saw and pulled back – but they remain uncomfortably near the brink.</p> <p>What has bothered observers is that the worst-affected sectors are those that have been the bedrock of market resilience – technology, digital and AI.</p> <p>Shares in the so-called “magnificent seven” beloved of Wall Street – Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Nvidia, Microsoft and Tesla – lost between 7 and 17 percent last week.</p> <p>Eurozone growth has slowed, led down by a German economy that seems to have lost its role as the world’s manufacturer of upmarket gadgets</p> <p>Investors were unconvinced by results from Alphabet that the huge sums invested in AI were going to show through in real returns. Financial statements from four of the seven this week could alleviate those worries – or (just as likely) compound them.</p> <p>If high tech is preoccupying America, in Europe it is upmarket handbags and gladrags that are causing investor concern.</p> <p>Almost all the big luxury brands – Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, YSL and the rest of the bauble manufacturers – are experiencing falling demand for their expensive goods, and the shares have suffered as a result. LVMH – Louis Vuitton, Dior and many more brands – has one of the highest market capitalisations in Europe, but its shares are down 9 percent this year.</p> <p>Moreover, eurozone economic growth has slowed almost to a trickle. It has been led down by a German economy that seems to have lost its role as the world’s manufacturer of upmarket gadgets from cars to turbines.</p> <p>Which brings the oil analysts to China. The West is in a love-hate relationship with China, loving the huge and increasingly sophisticated market, but hating the efficiency with which it can manufacture and export products that compete with Europe and North America.</p> <p>What they hate even more is a China that no longer wants, or cannot afford, Western products. Beijing’s well-known challenges in real estate and finance are trickling down the national economy to affect consumer confidence.</p> <p>That is bad news for the likes of LVMH throughout the world. It’s too early to say what effect falling Chinese demand for luxury goods will have on, for example, Dubai, where Chinese tourists flock to buy these expensive fripperies in the emirate’s grand malls.</p> <p>To the extent that consumer spending is a factor in national economic health, it becomes a problem for the world too – and for the Opec+ planners.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has forecast that Chinese GDP growth will fall below 4 percent in the near future – the lowest rate for nearly three decades.</p> <p>One of the assumptions the Opec+ experts must have made when they extended cuts in June, but with a gradual return beginning this October, was that Chinese demand for hydrocarbons would be showing definitive signs of recovery by the autumn.</p> <p>Just a couple of months on, that is not guaranteed. Whether or not Opec+ can begin to unwind the 2.2 million barrels per day reductions from this autumn is still up in the air.</p> <p>Certainly, the oil price is warning that there is little need for extra barrels for the time being. Along with US digital stocks and European luxury goods, the price of a barrel of Brent crude has fallen since the middle of the month – from around $85 to below $80.</p> <p>Food for thought on the Mediterranean beaches.</p> <p><em>Frank Kane is Editor-at-Large of AGBI and an award-winning business journalist.

Two are located 50km offshore. The third is about 100km off the Somali coast, with water depths of around 3,000m. </p> <p>To support Oruç Reis on its mission, the Turkish navy is to deploy warships in the region. Last week the Turkish parliament approved the basing of vessels in Somalia for two years. </p> <p>The naval deployment has been welcomed by the authorities in Mogadishu – but not by the leaders of the breakaway region of Somaliland, who have described the move as an infringement of its sovereign rights. </p> <p>Ankara is also close to sealing an agreement with Tripoli for Turkish vessels to survey areas of Libya’s coastal waters for oil and gas deposits, according to Bayraktar.</p> <p>There could still be obstacles, however. Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation with the national unity government in 2022. </p> <p>This was struck down by a court in February, on the grounds that the provisional government in Tripoli did not have the authority to commit Libya to long-term economic obligations. </p> <p>Survey efforts could also incur the ire of Mediterranean neighbours, particularly Greece and Egypt. </p> <p>In 2019 Turkey and Libya signed a pact establishing maritime economic exclusion zones in the Mediterranean that other countries see as infringing on their own extended territorial waters and continental shelf claims. </p> <p>Energy professor Dr Şenay Yalçın, dean of Bahcesehir International University Batumi, says the Libya deal is important and will help to expand Turkey’s reach in the Mediterranean – but it is the agreement with Somalia that offers the best opportunities to improve <a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/economy/2024/07/mena-economic-data-gdp-egypt-turkey/\">Turkey’s economy</a> and its soft power. </p> <p>“Under the Somali deal, Turkey will share its capabilities on searching and extracting natural gas and oil,” he told <em>AGBI</em>. The work will “be carried out as a partnership and brought to the world market”.</p> <p>Expanding into Africa will also help Turkey achieve its goal of becoming an energy hub, Yalçın said.</p> <p>“The natural gas and oil that will be extracted means Turkey would both guarantee its future hydrocarbon needs and as an energy hub it will be able to liquify the natural gas and sell it to European markets.”</p> <p>Not all energy analysts support the Somalia plan, however. Some believe Turkey’s energy interests would be best served closer to home. </p> <p>Turkey has invested heavily in seismic research ships to be deployed in the eastern Mediterranean, said energy policy and strategy expert Necdet Pamir. </p> <p>The surveys in Somalia “will neither contribute economically or politically to Turkey”, Pamir said. “Instead of going that far, why not improve your relations with Syria or Lebanon? The Libya deal is good as we have a riparian border with them. But where is Somalia?”</p>"

    "content":"<p>Masdar, the UAE’s state-backed clean energy company, has partnered with the French energy major TotalEnergies to develop the commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using methanol produced from green hydrogen in Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>The two companies agreed to assess the project’s viability after a “successful test flight” during Cop28 last December, which demonstrated the potential for converting methanol to SAF, Masdar said in a statement on Thursday.</p> <p>The project aims to help decarbonise hard-to-abate emission-intensive sectors such as the aviation and maritime industries. The green hydrogen will be produced from renewable energy, while using the CO2 captured from an industrial source as a feedstock.</p> <p><strong><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Newsletter</mark></strong><br><a href=\"https://agbi.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=6dad398e61eeeae726961d9fd&amp;id=9d63dc202b\"><mark class=\"has-inline-color has-gold-color\">Get the Best of AGBI delivered straight to your inbox every week</mark></a></p> <p>SAF is an alternative liquid fuel produced from sources including waste oil and fats, green and municipal waste and non-food crops, or synthesised using captured carbon.</p> <p>According to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), its use could contribute around 65 percent of the emissions reduction needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. </p> <p>Only 600 million litres of SAF were produced worldwide in 2023, according to Iata statistics. This output is expected to triple this year but is still marginal. </p> <p>The air transport sector will need almost 450 billion litres of SAF by 2050 to reach the zero target.</p> <p>The UAE set a voluntary target of providing <a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/renewable-energy/2023/12/uae-sets-sustainable-aviation-fuel-targets/\">1 percent</a> of locally produced SAF to national airlines at UAE airports by 2031.</p> <p>The Gulf state seeks to develop a national regulatory framework for SAF to support the long-term economic operation of facilities for it in the country. By 2030, the UAE plans to produce 700 million litres of SAF annually.</p> <p>Masdar, owned by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Taqa, and one of the <a href=\"https://www.agbi.com/topics/swfs/\">sovereign wealth funds</a>, Mubadala, has a mandate to reach a portfolio of 100 gigawatts (GW) of renewables worldwide by 2030 and aims to become a leading producer of green hydrogen.</p> <p>Aviation is the focus of its green hydrogen business. The company has developed a number of strategic partnerships over the last three years, including agreements with Boeing and Airbus to support the development and growth of the SAF industry.</p> <p><strong><mark style=\"color:#978543\" class=\"has-inline-color\">The hydrogen rainbow</mark></strong></p>"
